## Battleship

[demo](shahriernafis.github.io/Battleship/)

This is a simple Battleship game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a 10x10 grid for each player, with the objective of sinking all of the opponent's ships before they sink all of yours.

### Step 1: HTML

The HTML code for the game is relatively straightforward. The main elements are the two boards (one for each player), the ship picker, and the play button.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
    <script type="module" src="./script.js" defer></script>
    <title>Battleship</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="ship-picker"></div>
    <div id="player"></div>
    <dis id="play"></dis>
    <div id="ai"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Step 2: CSS

The CSS code for the game is also relatively simple. The main styles are for the boards, the ships, and the play button.

```css
#ship-picker {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

#player, #ai {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(10, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(10, 1fr);
  gap: 1px;
}

.cell {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

.ship {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

.ship-cell {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: blue;
}

#play {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
